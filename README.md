On my home computer using Visual Studio code, I have everything working as it says in the document. When I upload my files and publish on github the sliders dissapear and do not show up. You can see all of the implemented code for them to work, and they do on my home computer with all of the features required. Also the coloring and styling of the tabs changed when I published the assignment on github. If whoever is grading this can give me an answer on why this happens I would appreciate it, but i'm out of time to debug and have other projects to work on.
